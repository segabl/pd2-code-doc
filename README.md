# PAYDAY 2 Code Documentation

This is a collection of Lua files documenting PAYDAY 2's engine types and library functions for use with [sumneko's Lua language server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server). Install the plugin for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and add these files to your Lua library to get hints when working with them.
